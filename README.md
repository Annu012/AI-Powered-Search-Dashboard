# AI-Powered Search Dashboard

## Overview
The **AI-Powered Search Dashboard** is a web-based application designed to enhance data-driven insights by automating web searches and structuring results. This app allows users to upload datasets, define dynamic search prompts, and retrieve structured information using SerpAPI and OpenAI's GPT-4 (or another LLM). The results can then be downloaded in a CSV format for further analysis.

---

## Features
1. **Upload Dataset:**  
   Upload data from a CSV file or directly via a Google Sheets URL for processing.
   
2. **Customizable Search Prompts:**  
   Define search prompts with placeholders for dynamic queries, such as `Find the email address of {entity}`.

3. **Automated Web Search:**  
   Use SerpAPI to perform automated searches for each entity in a selected dataset column.

4. **LLM Parsing:**  
   Utilize OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4 to extract and structure relevant data from web search results.

5. **Results Download:**  
   Download structured search results as a CSV file for offline use.

## Prerequisites
To use the application, ensure you have the following:
1. **SerpAPI API Key:**  
   Sign up at [SerpAPI](https://serpapi.com/) and obtain an API key.
   
2. **OpenAI API Key:**  
   Obtain your API key from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/).
   
3. **Google Sheets API Credentials (optional):**  
   - Enable the Google Sheets API in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).  
   - Download your `credentials.json` file for accessing Google Sheets.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask:** Backend framework for serving the web application.  
- **SerpAPI:** API for performing automated web searches.  
- **OpenAI API:** GPT-4 integration for parsing and structuring search results.  
- **Pandas:** For handling and processing CSV data.  
- **Google Sheets API:** For reading data directly from Google Sheets.  

---

## Notes
- **Rate Limits:**  
  Be mindful of rate limits for both SerpAPI and OpenAI. Adjust rate-limiting settings in `app.py` as necessary.

- **Environment Variables:**  
  Keep your `.env` file secure as it contains sensitive API keys.

- **Error Handling:**  
  Ensure that your dataset is well-structured to avoid issues during processing.
